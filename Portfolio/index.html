      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate and motivated student pursuing a Bachelor of
        Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering with a
        specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) at
        SRM Institute of Science and Technology, NCR Campus, Ghaziabad. I'm
        currently in my 3rd year (Batch: 2023â€“2027). I have a strong interest in
        frontend web development and enjoy bringing user interfaces to life
        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also enjoy solving problems and
        building projects using Python, which has helped me strengthen my
        logical thinking and software development skills. My academic journey
        began at Little Flower House School in Kakarmatta, Varanasi, where I
        completed both my 10th and 12th grades. I scored 81% in my 10th standard
        and 70.4% in my 12th, which laid the foundation for my technical career.
        Beyond academics and coding, I enjoy engaging in outdoor sports,
        spending quality time with my family, and exploring new technologies. My
        hobbies help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and fuel my creativity in
        tech. I am eager to learn, collaborate, and grow in the field of
        technology while contributing meaningfully to the projects and
        communities I am part of.
